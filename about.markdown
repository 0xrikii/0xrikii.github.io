    <p class="mb-3">Hi! I’m an Information Technology graduate with a strong interest in cybersecurity, particularly in ethical hacking and penetration testing.</p>
    <p class="mb-3">I spend most of my time learning through hands-on labs on platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box, while also participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions to strengthen my practical skills.</p>
    <p class="mb-3">This blog is where I share what I’ve learned—ranging from vulnerability write-ups, walkthroughs of CTF challenges, notes from my studies, and my journey toward becoming a professional penetration tester.</p>
